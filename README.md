# slack-scrabble

Converts text into much more fun scrabble letter text for easy copy paste into slack.

## How is this possible?

Using the power of AI (An Input) and NLP (Non-learning process) this really dumb converter takes simple text input
and through the magic of an array map converts it into silly pictures. Whaaaaaaaaaat??

## How can I use this?

Copy the output (push button!) and paste into the Slack channel of your choice.

## But my text doesn't convert to pretty pictures?

You have to install the super-awesome slack-scrabble letters. They are provided in an easy one-click archive file.
